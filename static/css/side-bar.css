/* ADD rules to make the side bar responsive:

As it is for now, create a jquery for the sidebar to collapse in a hamburger menu wich will live
in tjhe horizontal navbar (wich holds the logo); position it at the right (as a drawer menu wwith shadow in order to obscure (and lock) down layers.

/* ADD a rule to clip longer titles of the 'page items'.

It would be nice to clip it this way:
"This is a very long title for a page item" 
to
"This is a very long title ..."
