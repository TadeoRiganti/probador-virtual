FEATURES:

PROBLEM:
When visiting the site in a Desktop PC, Ar button doesn't show as it is a movile feature only.
This solution doesn't impact the overall experience, unless the user opens up the site on its movile device.

INITIAL SOLUTION: 
Provide a QR (that only shows in desktop) that let's user to acces the model with their movile devices.

ISSUES:
As explained by [Elalish](https://github.com/google/model-viewer/discussions/2933#discussioncomment-1554375), in order to work user need to download the 3d asset in it's device (this happens every time a user visits the site).
Because downloading something without seeing first is a hazard, there is no way around.

BRAINSTORMING:
a) To have a dedicated page for each model, that when visiting that URL allows to download the model and then prompting the user to view it int it's space.
  ‚úîÔ∏è It can improve user experience by adding general tips to help new users use this feature.
  ‚ùå It will be needed to code an extra page for each model.
      üí° Since 3D assets are not embedded on each page, it's possible to resolve this with a dynamic page wich loads the model's id);
b) A QR code to the same page, maybe with the #id of the 3D model.
  ‚úîÔ∏è Easy to implement. No extra development needed.Ô∏è
  ‚ùå It's not straight-foward, or at least in the best case, users needs to figure it out and look for the Ar button.
      üí° A script could be set on place, to trigger some CTA to prompt users to use the AR button whenever someone enters the site through that particular url.
