# Virtual try-on

In this project I'll be experimenting with the web component 'model-viewer' _(by Google)_, first to test and showcase a variety of examples and features, and later on _(once I satisfied my curiosity)_ I'll rename the project as a landing page for a __'Virtual Try-on' service__ for ecommerce in the furniture sector. 

## Examples

I'll design and develop a few examples featuring some cool properties of this technollogy, to showcase the potencial use case scenarios, without going for extravagant but useless ideas (like business cards) or too far away (like showcasing a yatch).

For now I'll focus on something easy to locate and test, such as furniture's products. Later I'll try with real state uses.
### Furniture

#### 1. Sofa configurator 

- __Features:__
    - Mesh variants with a drop-down list _(For the body count)_. Easy and simple.
    <!-- - Mesh variants with a drop-down list _(For type of legs)_. 3D Configurator idea. -->
    - Texture variants with buttons or a drop-down list _(for the upholstery)_.
    - Optional: Layers visibility _(extras like pillows)_

- __Design:__ 
    - __Reference:__ Karlstad by IKEA in 3 options: 3, 2 an 1 body. Maybe I'll build and add an L and U shape. Need to attach the author (for the 3 first)
    - __Style:__ Modular and minimalist, simple lineas 

- __Challenges:__ 
    - I've to edit them and change the base color. Reduce the size and build the L and U shaped models.
    - Add a script to change information with the model selected. Althought for starters I can describe it in general ways, without referring to the body's count.

#### 2. Sofa-bed or "Relax" armchair 

- __Features:__
    - Texture variants with buttons or a drop-down list _(For the color upholstery)_.
    - Rig animation _(Bed to Sofa)_.

- __Design:__ 
    - __Reference:__ Mechanism like [Thomas sofa by Divanlito](https://divanlito.com/product/605/thomas.html) more clean to animate or [KB](https://divanlito.com/p/378/kb.html) more mainstream design. If I go for the "relax" armchair I could use a ready-made model (if I can find it) or build it basing it on [Relax by Living Factory](https://livingfactory.com.ar/producto/sillon-relax/) _(mainstream design and easy to model)_ or maybe [Scarlet by Divanlito](https://divanlito.com/product/329/scarlet.html) or [others](https://divanlito.com/category/46/Relax.html?page=1&view=small&p=hidden).
    - __Style:__ It has an industrial style and it's so mainstream that a lot of prospects have it on its own catalog.

- __Challenges:__ I've alredy done the blueprint (for another project), so now I just have to finish the model and rig it.

#### 3. Rack TV 

- __Features:__
    - Texture variants.
    - Interactive animated parts _(as open drawers)_.

- __Design:__ 
    - __Reference:__ The 3D model is alredy built, I can't remember the reference but I'll add it later. 
    - __Style:__ It has an industrial style and it's so mainstream that a lot of prospects have it on its own catalog.

- __Challenges:__ I've alredy done the blueprint (for another project), so now I just have to finish the model and rig it.

#### 4. Kitchen

- __Features:__
    - Light effects _(post-process)_.
    - Interactive animated parts _(as open drawers)_. 

 - __Design:__ 
    - __Reference:__ The model will be inspired on the furniture [Linea Zen by Battista](https://www.battista.com.ar/diseno-cocina-zen/) 
    - __Style:__ Minimalist, straight shapes, modular; it's a common style between prospects and it's easy to model.  


- __Challenges:__ For this model in particular there is no blueprint, no pictures that are usefull as references, so I'll design it from scratch _(trying not to just copy but to create something slightly different)_. This way I can show that the model is realisitc render.

# Business

##  Prospect list

For now, my idea is to prospect Argentine companies first and then expand to the world (Argentina → LATAM → World). First because it's easier for me to evaluate the business's idea.
So, for now I'll research and develop a Minimum Viable Product adapted for __SMEs companies__.

### Furniture:

#### Living

Ideal for customizable products _(configurator)_, 
big products and with mechanisms _(such as sofa-beds)_. 

- [Living Factory](https://livingfactory.com.ar/) | They don't really qualify, but they have a __product configurator__ *(2D and only colors)* that resonates with the client experience this solution aims for. So, I'll take them into account for the MVP.
- [Facyca](https://facyca.com.ar/) | They use 3D models to show their products and a wide variety of __web technologies to showcase__ their products in a different way. 
- [Divanlito](https://divanlito.com/) | They promote themself as a high-end luxury products, but they rely on images to show their products. Because rich people usually have expensive smartphones, they __won't experience difficulties__ visualizing this type of solutions. 

#### Kitchen:

- [Tienda Milano](https://tiendamilano.com.ar/) | ...
- [Battista](https://www.battista.com.ar/) | 
- [Edgar Monlezun](https://www.edgarmonlezun.com.ar/cocina.html/) | In their site they have 360° views.
- [Ark Mobili](https://www.arkmobili.com.ar/amoblamientos-de-cocina-johnson-2/) | ...
- [Johnson Canning](https://johnsoncanning.com.ar/) | Their core value is to accompany the client, that aligns well with this type of solution.
- [Amoblamientos Reno](https://www.amoblamientosreno.com/) | ...
- [Starway Home Deco](https://starwayhomedeco.com/) | ..

- [Stands Company](https://standscompany.com.ar/) | They talk about they sell experiences but they heavily rely on images to showcase their work.
- [Gota Arquigrafia](https://gotaarquigrafia.com/) | They rely on images (and reputation).
